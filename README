DESCRIPTION: 
This repository serves as a hub for our code related to a MA arbitrage strategy we are developing.


REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3.13.2+ (we recommend using the latest stable Python release)
pip (bundled with most Python installations)
FOLDER STRUCTURE: MA_Arbitrage_Project/ ├── .gitignore ├── README.txt ├── requirements.txt ├── scripts/ │
 └── main_script.py └── venv/

.gitignore - Tells Git which files/folders to ignore, e.g., venv
README.txt - This documentation file
requirements.txt - List of Python dependencies
scripts/ - Directory containing Python scripts
venv/ - Local virtual environment folder (usually not committed to Git)

SETUP AND USAGE:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Hanliang-Xu/MA_Arbitrage_Project.git cd my_project
Create and activate a virtual environment:
   On Windows: python -m venv venv venv\Scripts\activate
   On macOS or Linux: python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python scripts/main_script.py (Follow any prompts, e.g., entering a ticker symbol)
Deactivate the virtual environment (when finished): deactivate

ISSUE RESOLUTION:
If you encounter any issues or bugs, please feel free to communicate!
Some common issues include:
   Missing dependencies: Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
   Incorrect Python version: Ensure you are using Python 3.13.2 or later. A good tool to manage Python versions is pyenv, which you can easily install from its GitHub repository.
   API errors: Verify that the API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
   Data issues: Confirm that the data source/files is accessible and up-to-date
   Import errors: Confirm you are importing correct modules, that all dependencies are installed, and you are running the script on the current environment/interpreter
